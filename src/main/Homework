1. what is singleton design pattern?
	- only one instance of class created throughout the application
	Steps:
		a) constructors should be private
		b) provide static method which returns ref. of instance
		 lazy initialisation concept is used to write static method
		c) instance is stored as private static variable
		class Student{
			private int rno;
			private String name;
			private static Student s;
			private Student(){

			}
			public static Student getStudent(){
				if(s==null)
				return new Student();
			}
		}
		class School{

		Student s = Student.getStudent();
		}


2. Explain authentication & authorization with an example?

3. Add Employee
	class Employee{
		Long id;
		String name;
		Boolean visitedFlag;
	}

	List<Employee> = fetch all employees whose visitedFlag is false
	randomly fetch one employee from list then update with visitedFlag true
